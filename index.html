                        <p>From my initial inquiry over Instagram, Jenny worked tirelessly to help me find the perfect antique diamond for my engagement ring. Her responsiveness over text and willingness to accommodate all of my (many) requests was unparalleled. 10/10 customer experience - look no further for your jewelry needs. <br>Jaye, November, 2019</p>

                    <h3>Authenticity Guarantee</h3>
                    <p>As certified by GIA, we are expertly trained in diamond grading. Many of the stones we carry are certified, but when they‚Äôre not, we guarantee the specifications given. We only buy from reputable dealers with whom we‚Äôve established a history. It‚Äôs part of the business to not only enjoy these relationships on a personal level, but to know that what we‚Äôre buying is authentic, quality jewelry with infinite beauty and intrinsic value. Even in these familiar instances, we carefully inspect every piece, making sure it reflects every detail necessary in order to deem it a legitimate designer, antique, or vintage treasure.</p>
